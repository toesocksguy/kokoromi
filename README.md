# Kokoromi

An open-source Android "habit" tracker built on Anne-Laure Le Cunff's [Tiny Experiments](https://nesslabs.com/book) framework for living life through systematic curiosity.

**Status**: v0.1.0 — Milestones 1–6 complete, Milestone 7 (Archive, Field Notes, Settings & Export) in progress  
**License**: GPL-3.0  
**Platform**: Android 8.0+ (API 26+)

## What is Kokoromi?

Most habit apps are built on shame and streaks. Kokoromi is built on curiosity. Instead of setting goals, you run small, time-bound experiments: "I will [action] for [duration]." You log what actually happened, reflect weekly, and decide what's next — keep going, adjust, or set it aside. No badges. No guilt. Just honest data and what you learn from it.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Curiosity over achievement** — Experiments are questions, not goals
2. **Simplicity over gamification** — No badges, no leaderboards, no shame mechanics
3. **User agency** — No dark patterns, no pressure. Opt-in reminders only, fully user-controlled
4. **Privacy by default** — All data stays on your device, zero telemetry
5. **Offline-first** — Works fully without internet
6. **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.1 AA, built in from the start

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Language** | Kotlin |
| **UI** | Jetpack Compose |
| **Architecture** | MVVM + Coroutines |
| **Database** | Room (SQLite) |
| **Dependency Injection** | Hilt |
| **Testing** | JUnit, Mockito, Compose Testing |
| **Build** | Gradle 8.13, Kotlin DSL |

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[org]/kokoromi.git
cd kokoromi
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Always use `./gradlew` rather than a system `gradle` command — the wrapper ensures everyone builds with the same Gradle version.

## Documentation

All design docs live in `docs/`. Start with [MANIFEST.md](docs/MANIFEST.md) — it has the full index, role-based reading guides, and a common questions FAQ.

## Known Issues & Remaining Work

**Bugs**
- Experiments paused via the completion screen ("set this aside") are stored with `ARCHIVED` status instead of `PAUSED`, so they appear in the wrong Archive tab and cannot be resumed. **Note:** `CompleteExperimentUseCaseTest` currently asserts `ARCHIVED` as the expected status for pause — fix those test assertions alongside the status fix, or the tests will fail after the bug is corrected.
- Resume button for paused experiments is not yet implemented in the Archive screen

**Backlog**
- Import data from JSON export (complement to existing export feature)

**Remaining M7 tasks**
- Unit tests for `GetReflectionPromptStateUseCase`, `GetActiveExperimentsWithLogsUseCase`, `UpdateExperimentStatusUseCase`
- Accessibility pass:
  - `ExperimentDetailScreen.kt` lines 336–339, 378–379: `LogItem` and `ReflectionItem` have empty `semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` blocks — hook is there but no `contentDescription`; timeline entries announce nothing to screen readers
  - `ArchiveScreen.kt` line 143: archive items describe hypothesis + status only; date range and completion rate (visible on screen) missing from `contentDescription`
  - `ExperimentCard.kt` lines 118–123: "Edit Log" button has no `contentDescription`; appears when today is already logged
  - Android Accessibility Scanner run
- Daily check-in reminder notification (opt-in):
  - `app/build.gradle.kts` — add `work-runtime-ktx:2.9.1`, `hilt-work:1.2.0`, `ksp(hilt-compiler:1.2.0)`
  - `AndroidManifest.xml` — `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission; disable default WorkManager initializer so Hilt can provide it
  - `res/drawable/ic_notification.xml` — monochrome notification bell icon
  - `Constants.kt` — add `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID`, `REMINDER_WORK_NAME`, pref keys
  - `UserPreferences.kt` — add `reminderEnabled: Boolean = false`, `reminderHour: Int = 20`, `reminderMinute: Int = 0`
  - `PreferencesRepository` / `DefaultPreferencesRepository` — add `setReminderEnabled` and `setReminderTime`
  - `KokoromiApp.kt` — create `NotificationChannel`; implement `Configuration.Provider` to inject `HiltWorkerFactory`
  - `notification/CheckInReminderWorker.kt` — `@HiltWorker`; queries active experiments + today's logs; fires notification only if any experiment unlogged
  - `notification/ReminderScheduler.kt` — schedules/cancels `PeriodicWorkRequest` with computed initial delay to hit user's chosen time
  - `SettingsViewModel.kt` — inject `ReminderScheduler`; `onReminderToggle` / `onReminderTimeChange` handlers
  - `SettingsScreen.kt` — Notifications section: Switch (off by default), time-picker row (shown when enabled), `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` runtime permission request on Android 13+
- Release CI: `.github/workflows/release.yml` — build and publish APK on git tag

## What's Not in v1

- ❌ Cloud sync (user can export to JSON)
- ❌ Push notifications, social alerts, or streak reminders
- ❌ Social features or sharing
- ❌ Experiment templates or suggestions
- ❌ Gamification (streaks that reset, badges, leaderboards)

## A Note on How This Was Built

This project was designed and built through **prompt-architecting with Claude Code** (Anthropic's AI coding assistant). The developer directed the vision, made key product decisions, and reviewed all output — with the AI contributing to architectural decisions, code generation, and documentation throughout.

This is sometimes called "vibe-coding." Being transparent about it feels consistent with this project's values of honesty and curiosity. The code works, the architecture is sound, and the philosophy is genuine — the tools used to build it don't change that.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please read [OPEN_SOURCE_GUIDE.md](docs/OPEN_SOURCE_GUIDE.md) before submitting a PR.

Feature ideas that add gamification, pressure-based notifications, social comparison, or cloud telemetry will not be merged — see [PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md) for why.
